        <h2>The WisePath Method</h2>
        <p>
          Every business has moving parts. We give those parts a structure, a flow, and a system
          that doesn’t depend on you manually holding everything together.
          The WisePath Method is a five–step framework for taking a noisy operation and turning
          it into a stable, automated machine.

            <h3>1. Diagnose</h3>
            <p>
              We start with a deep audit of your current systems, tools, communication, and bottlenecks.
              We map where time is wasted, where information gets lost, and where money leaks out.

            <h3>2. Identify</h3>
            <p>
              We identify the critical processes that drive your business—sales, fulfillment,
              customer experience, scheduling, reporting—and define exactly what “healthy” should look like.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Build</h3>
            <p>
              We design and build your architecture: workflows, automations, dashboards, and data structures.
              Everything is documented and designed to be understood by your team, not just a developer.

            <h3>4. Structure</h3>
            <p>
              We implement the systems in your real environment—CRMs, calendars, project tools, forms, inboxes—
              and create clear roles, handoffs, and checklists so the business can run the same way every day.

            <p>
              We monitor performance, track key metrics, and make adjustments as your business grows.
              Systems are living things—we tune them so they stay clean, stable, and reliable.
